This respository contains solutions to SoftComputing Assignment 2.
There are two pdf's containing solution to questiong in homework_two.pdf.

The python code provides implementation of Neural Network for signal data. 
For Instance data containing 90 features and [-1, 1] labels. 
You can change the hyperparameters of the Neural Network as per your training
and testing requirements.
The model is trained with Cross-Validation and achieves an sufficiently good accuracy
of 92% on my trained data and has been validated with scikit-learn Neural Network model.

The SOURCE_CODE folder containes implementation of the neural network in C Programming language.

Thanks
